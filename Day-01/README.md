# Cyber Security Internship Diary

Welcome to my Cyber Security Internship Diary! This repository is a day-by-day account of what I learn during my internship in the field of Cyber Security. Here, I'll share insights, concepts, and practices that I encounter throughout this journey.

## Day 1: Introduction to Cyber Security

### Topics Covered

#### 1. **Introduction to Cyber Security**
- **Definition:** Cyber Security involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or interrupt normal business processes.
- **Importance:** It is vital for safeguarding data, maintaining trust, and ensuring the smooth operation of organizations and personal activities in a digital age.
- **Scope:** Cyber Security covers various domains, including network security, application security, information security, operational security, and disaster recovery.

#### 2. **Types of Cyber Threats**
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device or network.
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Eavesdropping attacks where the attacker intercepts and relays messages between two parties.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

#### 3. **Basic Concepts of CIA**
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity:** Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

#### 4. **Cybersecurity Ethics, Principles, and Best Practices**
- **Ethics:** Upholding moral principles in the practice of cyber security, such as respecting privacy and ensuring the ethical use of data.
- **Principles:** Core principles including least privilege, defense in depth, and risk management.
- **Best Practices:** Implementing measures such as regular updates, strong passwords, encryption, and user education to enhance security.

#### 5. **Networking Concepts**
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** A method used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** A protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) that is recognized in the local network.
