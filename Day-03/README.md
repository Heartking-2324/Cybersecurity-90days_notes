# Cyber Security Internship Diary

Welcome back to my Cyber Security Internship Diary! This repository documents my daily learnings and experiences during my internship in the field of Cyber Security. Here, I'll share insights, concepts, and practices that I encounter throughout this journey.

## Day 3: Introduction to Windows

### Topics Covered

#### 1. **Introduction to Windows**
Today, we explored the Windows operating system, its features, and its relevance in cyber security. Understanding Windows is crucial for both defending against and investigating cyber threats.

#### 2. **Access Control Types, Permissions, and UAC**
- **Access Control Types:** Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Permissions:** Read, Write, Execute, and Modify permissions for files and directories.
- **User Account Control (UAC):** A security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system.

#### 3. **Windows Firewall and Windows Defender**
- **Windows Firewall:** A built-in firewall that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- **Windows Defender:** An anti-malware component that provides real-time protection against software threats like viruses and spyware.

#### 4. **Windows Remote Management and RDP**
- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM):** A feature that allows administrators to remotely execute management tasks on Windows machines.
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network.

#### 5. **Basic CMD Commands and Batch Scripting**
- **Basic CMD Commands:** 
  - **`dir`**: Lists directory contents.
  - **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
  - **`copy`**: Copies files from one location to another.
  - **`del`**: Deletes one or more files.
  - **`echo`**: Displays messages or turns command echoing on or off.

- **Batch Scripting:** Writing scripts to automate tasks using CMD commands.

#### 6. **Introduction to PowerShell**
- **PowerShell:** A task automation framework consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language built on the .NET framework. It provides powerful features for system administration.

#### 7. **Using CMD and PowerShell for System Administration and Basic Security Tasks**
- **System Administration:** Managing users, processes, and services using CMD and PowerShell.
- **Basic Security Tasks:** Implementing security measures, checking system integrity, and monitoring for potential threats.

### Practical Experience

We were fortunate enough to witness a demonstration of how malware can affect a system and bypass Windows Defender. This included:
- **Understanding Malware Behavior:** Observing how malware operates and spreads within a system.
- **Bypassing Windows Defender:** Techniques used by malware to evade detection and mitigation by Windows Defender.
